# CS7CS4
CS7CS4 Machine Learning
Running the "main.py" file performs the followings tasks:
1. Runs "feature_builder.py". This compiles the data from the 4 csv data files into a new csv file called "feature_file.csv"
2. Runs "KNN.py". This trains and assesses a KNN model using "feature_file.csv".
3. Runs "Log_reg.py". This trains and assesses a Logistic Regression model also using "feature_file.csv".

Depending on the IDE being used, the files "feature_builder.py" and "KNN.py" may need to be in a subfolder called "venv" as was the case for us using Pycharm.
The 4 data files required to run the project are:
"air_full.csv"
"fires_full.csv"
"rain_and_temp_full.csv"
"wind_full.csv"
